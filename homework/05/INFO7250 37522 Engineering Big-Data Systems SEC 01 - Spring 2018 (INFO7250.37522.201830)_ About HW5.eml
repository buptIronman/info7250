Part 2. Use a Custom Writable object with 3 attributes, that will be used as a value.
KEY: stock_symbol
VALUE: CustomWritableObject

Part 3. In the previous assignment, we wrote a MapReduce to find the access count for each IP Address.
MapReduce framework sorts the values based on the key.
In this part, we use Secondary Sorting to sort he values based on the access date.
KEY: {IP, access-date}
VALUE: 1

We need to define
- Composite Key Comparator using the 2nd part of the Composite Key
- Natural Key Grouping using the 1st part of the key.

Attached is additional reference material on Secondary Sorting.

Part 4. Write a MapReduce to determine the average stock price, but we want to use an implementation in which a Combiner could be used. Refer to the slides.

Part 5. Determine the Median and Std Dev.
The easiest way to do this would be let the Mapper emit key value pairs, and then in the Reducer insert all the values of each key in a Java Collection object.
Finally, you loop through the collection object to calculate the required statistical measures.
Refer to the slides

Part 6. Redo Part 5, but keep frequency of each rating to avoid memory issues.
Refer to the slides.

Let me know if you have any questions or concerns.
